The application must be run on Android Lollipop with the API level of 22 (Android 5.1) and can be run on the Pixel 2 XL

In Sprint II, we:

	1. Revamped the UI
	2. Added notifications
	3. Added goal-tracking in the database!

While we made large improvements off of Sprint I, we still have to add badges. After that, we firmly believe we will have satisfied the requirements of the client.
